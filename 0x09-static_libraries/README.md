/*================================= 0x09. C - Static libraries ================================================*/

#A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
#The static library libmy.a containing all the functions

#Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
#A script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library
#called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
